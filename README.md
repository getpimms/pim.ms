## Introduction

**PIMMS** is an open-source deep-linking and analytics platform designed to help marketing teams, solopreneurs, indie hackers, and influencers optimize user experience, preserve conversions, and clearly understand what's driving their results.

Whether you’re directing traffic from social media, emails, QR codes, or messaging platforms, PIMMS ensures users land in the right app—boosting conversion rates, eliminating friction, and providing detailed analytics on every interaction.

## Core Features

### 🔗 Advanced deep linking
Ensure users land directly within the correct mobile app (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, Spotify, and more). This improves user experience dramatically, reduces drop-offs, and maximizes the value of every interaction.

### 🌐 Branded custom domains
Create short, branded deep links to improve trust, increase click-through rates, and enhance brand visibility.

### 🎯 Comprehensive conversion tracking
Automatically track each interaction from initial click to valuable actions like signups, form submissions, and purchases. Clearly attribute conversions to specific campaigns and content.

### 📊 Real-time analytics
Gain instant insights into clicks, conversions, user devices, geolocations, browsers, referrers, and more. Identify high-performing channels, refine strategies quickly, and make data-driven decisions.

### 📱 Dynamic QR codes
Automatically generate branded QR codes that instantly open content in native mobile apps. Ideal for offline promotions, print materials, and in-person events.

### 👥 Collaborative workspace
Invite your team members to easily manage and analyze your marketing links. Enterprise plans support SAML Single Sign-On (Okta, Google, Azure AD) for secure and seamless access.
